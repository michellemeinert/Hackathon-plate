# açaidiac

## Description 
açaidiac is an energizing, fun and healthy 'aphrodisiac' soda drink.

The idea is to use an exclusive party invitation as a call to action, and for the customer to get to know our superfood drink at said party. 
We're not selling a soft drink we're selling the feeling of freedom and letting go of yourself for a while, exlusively linked to the properties of our product and party. 

## Process
- brainstorming to find our superfood
- researching açai properties and different ways of selling the product
- researching landing pages 
- creating persona and problem statement
- crazy 8 (to get diffrent layout ideas as a team)
- creating lo-fi wireframes
- doing styles (color palette and typography)
- searching for images 
- hi-fi wireframes
- html basic structure
- brand-building (name, slogan, ...)
- applying css
